_________________________________________________________
This Microsoft Research Digital Image license agreement ("MSR-DILA") is a legal agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft” or “we”) for the digital images or data identified above, which may include digital images, and any associated materials, text or speech files, associated media and "online" or electronic documentation (together, the "Images"). 

By downloading, or otherwise using the Images found at http://research.microsoft.com/downloads or ftp://ftp.research.microsoft.com/pub/download/orid, 
you agree to be bound by the terms of this MSR-DILA. If you do not agree, do not download or use the Images.  The Images are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and are licensed, not sold.    

SCOPE OF RIGHTS:
You may use, copy, reproduce, and distribute the Images for any non-commercial purpose, subject to the restrictions in this MSR-DILA.  Some purposes which can be non-commercial are teaching, academic research, public demonstrations and personal experimentation. You may also distribute the Images with books or other teaching materials, or publish the Images on websites, that are intended for academic or other non-commercial purposes.
You may not use or distribute the Images or any derivative works in any form for commercial purposes. Examples of commercial purposes would be licensing, leasing, or selling the Images, distributing the Images for use with commercial products, or using the Images with a purpose to procure a commercial gain to you or others.
In return, we simply require that you agree: 
1.That if you distribute the Images or any derivative works of the Images, you will distribute them under a verbatim copy of this license, and you will not grant other rights to the Images or derivative works that are different from those provided by this MSR-DILA. 
2.That if you have created derivative works of the Images, and distribute such derivative works, you will cause the modified files to carry prominent notices so that recipients know that they are not receiving the original Images. Such notices must state: (i) that you have changed the Images; and (ii) the date of any changes.
3.That Microsoft is granted back, without any restrictions or limitations, a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, assignable and sub-licensable license, to reproduce, publicly perform or display, install, use, modify, distribute, make and have made, sell and transfer your modifications to and/or derivative works of the Images, for any purpose.  
4.That any feedback about the Images provided by you to us is voluntarily given, and Microsoft shall be free to use the feedback as it sees fit without obligation or restriction of any kind, even if the feedback is designated by you as confidential. 
5.THAT THE IMAGES COME "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTIES. THIS MEANS NO EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, any warranty against interference with your enjoyment of the Images OR ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. There is no warranty that the Images will fulfill any of your particular purposes or needs. ALSO, YOU MUST PASS THIS DISCLAIMER ON WHENEVER YOU DISTRIBUTE THE IMAGES OR DERIVATIVE WORKS.
6.That if you breach the terms of this MSR-DILA, this MSR-DILA (and your license and rights obtained herein) terminates automatically.  Upon any such termination, you shall destroy all of your copies of the Images immediately.  
7.That the Images may be subject to U.S. export jurisdiction at the time they are licensed to you, and they may be subject to additional export or import laws in other places.  You agree to comply with all such laws and regulations that may apply to the Images after delivery of the images to you.
8.That all rights not expressly granted to you in this MSR-DILA are reserved.
9.That this MSR-DILA shall be construed and controlled by the laws of the State of Washington, USA, without regard to conflicts of law.  If any provision of this MSR-DILA shall be deemed unenforceable or contrary to law, the rest of this MSR-DILA shall remain in full effect and interpreted in an enforceable manner that most nearly captures the intent of the original language.
